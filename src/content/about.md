I am a software engineer with professional experience since 2018, working across a broad range of domains including software development, systems architecture, cloud infrastructure, DevOps, networking, data processing, and operational security. Over the years, I have built a diverse technical foundation that enables me to design and deliver secure, efficient, and reliable solutions. My work is guided by a balance of security, functionality, and optimization, with a strong emphasis on code correctness, maintainability, and long-term sustainability.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to projects ranging from building scalable cloud-native applications to establishing modern DevOps practices and implementing secure system architectures. I thrive at the intersection of development and operations, where thoughtful technical decisions directly influence performance, reliability, and business outcomes. My hands-on approach, combined with a commitment to precision and accountability, allows me to consistently deliver results in complex and high-impact environments.

Currently, I am on the path to becoming a systems and software architect, expanding my focus beyond coding and implementation to system-wide design and long-term strategic decision-making. My goal is to bridge technical excellence with business objectives, ensuring that technology choices not only address immediate challenges but also create sustainable value for the future.

I view engineering as both a craft and a discipline - one that requires adaptability, continuous learning, and curiosity. I am committed to professional growth, staying engaged with emerging technologies while grounding my work in proven principles of design, architecture, and security. Always motivated by new challenges, I aim to apply my expertise where it can have the greatest impact.

## Philosophy

I approach engineering with a mindset grounded in clarity, simplicity, and maintainability. I believe in designing systems that are robust, efficient, and secure, while remaining adaptable to change. A key guiding principle in my work is adherence to the 17 Unix Rules by Eric Raymond, which emphasize modularity, transparency, and the importance of building tools that do one thing well. Following these principles ensures that software and systems remain reliable, understandable, and extensible over time, enabling both individual and team productivity.

```
01. Build modular programs
02. Write readable programs
03. Use composition
04. Separate mechanisms from policy
05. Write simple programs
06. Write small programs
07. Write transparent programs
08. Write robust programs
09. Make data complicated when required, not the program
10. Build on potential users' expected knowledge
11. Avoid unnecessary output
12. Write programs which fail in a way that is easy to diagnose
13. Value developer time over machine time
14. Write abstract programs that generate code instead of writing code by hand
15. Prototype software before polishing it
16. Write flexible and open programs
17. Make the program and protocols extensible.
